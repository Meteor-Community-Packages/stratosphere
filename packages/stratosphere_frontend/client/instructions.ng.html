                <h2>Installation</h2>
                Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/sebakerckhof/stratosphere" target="_blank">README</a>.
                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>
                To publish and sync with Stratosphere, you have to set the package server URL to your stratosphere URL.
                This can be achieved by setting the environment variable: <pre><code>METEOR_PACKAGE_SERVER_URL</code></pre> to your package server url.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You can not immediately publish stand-alone packages. Meteor first needs to create and fill up a new package database file.
                    This is automatically done for you when you try to run an existing meteor project with the environment variable set.
                    First time syncing can take long (up to 10min), since it needs to import all package data from the official package repo and do some processing on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meteor splits the package database and package files according to this URL, so you should be able to switch package servers back and forth by changing this variable.
                </p>
                <h2>Access Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Note that there is no way to protect who can see and synchronize packages! Therefore, you probably want to run Stratosphere inside a firewall protected part of your organization.<br>
                    But you can protect who can publish and unpublish pacakges by setting <pre><code>public.loginRequired</code></pre> in the settings.json file.<br>
                    You will need to add at least one superUser in the settings.json file (a meteor developer account username). SuperUsers can manage other user rights in the frontend.<br>
                </p>
